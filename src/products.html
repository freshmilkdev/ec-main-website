                        In the past further education institutions were awarded funding based on attendees being
                        admitted and retained for a brief period. The new government mandates extend the liability on
                        funding insomuch as the retention period is equal to the course duration. The conclusion of the
                        course is measured in terms of destination and funding is conditional effectiveness of a course.
                        Each college will offer a variety of courses and modules within those courses. In doing so, it
                        seeks to match its educational offering to the recruitment needs of the local economy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The college will receive a system to allow the balancing of risk across modules, courses and
                        academic years. This system empowers the roles of team members in the institution with cutting
                        edge analytics and displays guidance based on projected risk models as to the overall risk
                        associates with courses. The data for this will be derived through a Big Data analysis of MIS
                        data held by the institution combined with national and regional trends.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The college will be able to modify weights associated with these risk factors in order to build
                        a generic solution which is tailored to their institution and these risk models can be applied
                        at the point of admission to predict a likely outcome for a candidate applicant. Furthermore,
                        the college receives an integrated learning social network powered by Yammer, which facilitates
                        co-learning and engagement. The system will include a bulk load capability which enables Yammer
                        and reduces the overhead to the college for enabling the social network.

                        ANALYTICS THAT HELP YOU WIN AT BUILDING GAMES;
                        Cloud Predictions features a set of brilliant tools for Game Developers, from system for helping
                        you distribute custom artwork (dare we say &apos;user generated?&apos;) to tracking who&apos;s winning and
                        who&apos;s about to drop out of your game.
                    </p>
                    <p>With our managed Leaderboards, you can show players how they stack up against each other, against
                        their friends and against their countrymen. By utilising Cloud Predictions&apos; friendship based
                        Leaderboards, you can understand your players and their degrees of seperation from one another
                        with customised leaderboards. Uniquely in the market, Cloud Predictions supports thousands of
                        simultaneous leaderboards for your players across all of your games with real-time updates and
                        event hooks to enable custom achievements.</p>
                    <p>Cloud Predictions creates scalable groups of friends which can be used as the basis for complex
                        multiplayer scenarios. Using our system you can give players the freedom of control over who
                        they interact and can message in game or any other pre-designed collaborative scenario. With
                        Cloud Predictions you can track histories of friends groups over time and see how they evolve as
                        the gameplay evolves. Whilst this is a perfect solution for players that want to build friends
                        networks it&apos;s also a great analysis tool for games designers to show the spread of friendship
                        over time and how it relates to gameplay.</p>
                    <p>Use Cloud Predictions to store large volumes of digital assets per game. Cloud Predictions allow
                        you to store terabytes of graphics and files so that you can customise the game experience for
                        each player. Players can upload their own rules and avatars as needed and these will be
                        propagated around the world within minutes. This allows the player to have a fantastic gameplay
                        experience and enables you, the games designer, to not worry about storage. Cloud Predictions
                        uses the Microsoft Azure CDN with tens of locations around the world allowing the most remote
                        gamers to have a great player experience.</p>
                    <p>Cloud Predictions offers a comprehensive player churn model. Using advanced artificial
                        intelligence and machine learning techniques we can predict with up to 90% accuracy whether this
                        player session will be the last allowing you to work out whether to offer them other similar
                        games in your portfolio or discount in-player deals to keep their engagement. The predictions
                        are made in real-time at the end of each session so can be wired up to a marketing system. Cloud
                        Predictions has based their churn model on complex academic peer reviewed papers to bring you
                        the foresight that only the largest games companies in the world can command with teams of data
                        scientists.</p>
                    <p>
                        Understand whether you are retaining your players with individual scores to show how the basic
                        engagement with them fares against against other players in their initial cohort. Cloud
                        Predictions creates automatic buckets for all your users based on their start date enabling you
                        to consider A/B scenarios.
                    </p>
                    <p>Player Retention can be used to show whether starting on certain days of the week or holiday
                        periods will affect whether payers spend more time playing your game. Cloud Predictions shows
                        you how these retention values change over time with new cohorts allowing the games designer to
                        understand how general changes in the game affect a player&apos;s overall interest.</p>
