                    <p>The cloud requires a different mode of thinking with application architecture and new design paradigms. Many businesses start moving their application architecture to the cloud and suffer performance and deployment problems. Elastacloud has gained expertise at profiling performance issues and optimising applications which have been moved across to Azure with an on-premise mentality. Let elastacloud help you diagnose your latencies in the cloud.
